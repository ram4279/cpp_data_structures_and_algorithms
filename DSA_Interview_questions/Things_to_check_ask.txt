Think and ask about constraints:
================================
1. What will be the inputs?  all positive numbers, negative numbers
2. Will there be solution always?
3. Will there be duplicates?
4. What should be return value?
5. Think about boundary cases?
6. Need multiple results or one result enough?

Write some test cases:
======================
1. List a TC having solution
2. List a TC having no solution
3. If arrays are to be given as input
    - Consider empty array
    - Consider sorted array

Write code:
===========
1. Come up with naive or bruteforce solution first
2. Identify DS or algo that can reduce the time complexity
3. Check bit manipulation is possible
4. Write code.

Revisit code:
=============
1. Check typo of variable names
2. Check open and close braces
3. Check Semi colon / intendation
4. Walk through each line of code

Test/Debug solution:
====================
Add logs at necessary places

Hints:
======
1. Check for words like greatest (maximum value question), smallest(minimum value question) in the question
2. Check if caching is needed
3. Check if two pointers can help
