What is DHCP:
==============
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other related network configuration parameters to devices on a network. It allows devices to obtain necessary network configuration information from a DHCP server, rather than requiring the user or administrator to manually configure each device.

DHCP operates using a client-server model, where the DHCP server maintains a pool of available IP addresses and other network configuration information, and the DHCP client requests this information from the server as needed. When a device connects to a network, it sends a broadcast message requesting an IP address and other configuration information. The DHCP server responds with an offer message, which includes an available IP address and other configuration parameters, such as the subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server information. The client can then accept the offer and use the provided configuration to communicate on the network.

DHCP can greatly simplify the process of configuring and managing a network, as it allows devices to automatically obtain the necessary network configuration information without the need for manual intervention. It is widely used on networks of all sizes, from home networks to enterprise-level networks.


Explain the steps involved in DHCP ?
====================================
The process of obtaining an IP address and other network configuration information from a DHCP server involves the following steps:

- Device connection: When a device connects to a network, it sends a broadcast message requesting an IP address and other configuration information.
- Offer message: The DHCP server receives the request and responds with an offer message, which includes an available IP address and other configuration parameters such as the subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server information.
- Request message: The client device sends a request message to the DHCP server, acknowledging the offer and requesting that the offered IP address and configuration be reserved for its use.
- Acknowledgment message: The DHCP server sends an acknowledgment message, confirming that the requested IP address and configuration have been reserved for the client.
- Configuration: The client device configures itself with the IP address and other network configuration information received from the DHCP server, and begins using these settings to communicate on the network.
- Lease renewal: The DHCP server assigns a lease duration for the IP address and configuration, after which the client must request a renewal of the lease in order to continue using the assigned IP address and configuration. The renewal process involves steps similar to the initial request process, with the client sending a request message and the server responding with an acknowledgment message.
- Overall, the DHCP process allows devices to automatically obtain the necessary network configuration information in a simple and efficient manner, without the need for manual intervention.

DHCP is which layer protocol ?
==============================
The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network layer protocol, operating at the OSI model's Network Layer (layer 3). It is responsible for assigning IP addresses and other related network configuration parameters to devices on a network, and operates using a client-server model.


Can you describe the role of the DHCP relay agent in a network?
================================================================
A DHCP relay agent is a network device that allows DHCP clients on one network segment to communicate with a DHCP server on a different network segment. It acts as a bridge between the client and server, forwarding DHCP messages between them.

The DHCP relay agent is typically used in networks that have multiple subnets, where the DHCP server is not directly reachable by the clients on all subnets. In this case, the relay agent can be configured to listen for DHCP requests from clients on a particular subnet, and forward these requests to the DHCP server. It can also forward the server's response back to the client.

This allows the DHCP server to assign IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to clients on subnets that are not directly connected to the server, and ensures that the clients can communicate with the server and obtain the necessary network configuration information.

Overall, the role of the DHCP relay agent is to facilitate communication between DHCP clients and servers on different network segments, and to enable the assignment of IP addresses and other configuration parameters to clients in these remote subnets.


How DHCP identifies duplicate IP address?
=========================================
There are several methods that the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) can use to identify and prevent the assignment of duplicate IP addresses on a network. These methods include:

**ARP probe**: When a DHCP server receives a request for an IP address from a client, it can send an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) probe to verify that the requested IP address is not already in use on the network. If the probe receives a response, the IP address is already in use and the server will not assign it to the requesting client.

**Ping test**: The DHCP server can also send a ping test to the requested IP address to verify that it is not already in use. If the ping test receives a response, the IP address is already in use and the server will not assign it to the requesting client.

**Lease duration**: The DHCP server can assign a lease duration for each IP address and configuration that it assigns to a client. If the client does not renew the lease before it expires, the server will mark the IP address as available and can assign it to a different client. This helps to prevent the assignment of duplicate IP addresses when a client goes offline or is no longer using the assigned IP address.
Overall, these methods help to prevent the assignment of duplicate IP addresses on a network, which can cause connectivity issues and other problems.



What is gracious arp
====================
Gracious ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) refers to a technique that is used to allow a device to release an IP address gracefully, without disrupting network connectivity for other devices. It involves sending an ARP announcement message to all other devices on the network to inform them that the device is releasing its IP address, and allowing them to update their ARP caches accordingly.

The purpose of gracious ARP is to ensure that network connectivity is not disrupted when a device releases an IP address. Without gracious ARP, other devices on the network may continue to send traffic to the IP address that was released, resulting in lost packets and potential connectivity issues.

Gracious ARP is typically used in conjunction with the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), which is responsible for assigning and releasing IP addresses on a network. It is an important technique for maintaining stable network connectivity, and is widely used on networks of all sizes.

What are scopes in DHCP
========================
In the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), a scope is a range of IP addresses that can be assigned to devices on a network. A DHCP server can be configured with one or more scopes, each of which defines a range of available IP addresses that can be assigned to clients.

Scopes are used to divide the available IP addresses on a network into logical groups, and allow the DHCP server to assign specific IP addresses or ranges of addresses to specific clients or groups of clients. This can be useful for organizing and managing the allocation of IP addresses on a network, and for enforcing specific network policies or configurations.

For example, a DHCP server may have a scope for each network segment or subnet, with a range of IP addresses that can be assigned to clients on that segment. It may also have separate scopes for different groups of clients, such as servers, workstations, or mobile devices, which allows the administrator to assign specific IP addresses or configurations to these groups.

Overall, scopes are a key concept in DHCP and allow the administrator to effectively manage and allocate IP addresses on a network.


SERVER SIDE PROCESS:

DHCPD is the server side process for DHCP. Configuration files /etc/dhcp.conf
