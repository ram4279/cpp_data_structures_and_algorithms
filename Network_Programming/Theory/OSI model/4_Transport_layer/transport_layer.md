What?
=====
The transport layer (layer 4) of the OSI model is responsible for providing end-to-end communication between devices on a network. It ensures that data is delivered reliably and in the correct order to the destination device.

The transport layer provides a logical communication channel between devices and is responsible for segmenting and reassembling data as it is transmitted between the devices. It also provides flow control to prevent the sender from overwhelming the receiver with too much data, and it provides error detection and correction to ensure that data is delivered correctly.

The transport layer is responsible for establishing and maintaining the connection between the devices, and it provides the necessary functions to ensure that the connection is reliable and efficient. It also provides multiplexing capabilities to allow multiple connections to be established between the devices.

Responsibilities
=================
Here are the main responsibilities of the transport layer (layer 4) of the OSI model:

- Segmentation and reassembly: The transport layer is responsible for dividing the data into smaller units, called segments, and reassembling the segments at the destination. This allows the data to be transmitted more efficiently over the network.
- End-to-end communication: The transport layer provides a logical communication channel between the devices on the network and is responsible for ensuring that the data is delivered reliably and in the correct order to the destination.
Connection establishment and maintenance: The transport layer is responsible for establishing and maintaining the connection between the devices. It provides the necessary functions to ensure that the connection is reliable and efficient.
- Flow control: The transport layer provides flow control to prevent the sender from overwhelming the receiver with too much data. It uses techniques such as windowing and congestion control to ensure that the data is transmitted at a rate that the receiver can handle.
- Error detection and correction: The transport layer provides error detection and correction to ensure that the data is delivered correctly. It uses techniques such as checksums and retransmission to detect and correct errors in the data.
- Multiplexing: The transport layer provides multiplexing capabilities to allow multiple connections to be established between the devices. It uses techniques such as port numbers to distinguish between different connections.


Other concepts:
===============
Socket is a combination of port number and ip address to uniquely indentify a connection.


There are two main protocols:
==============================
1. TCP
2. UDP
