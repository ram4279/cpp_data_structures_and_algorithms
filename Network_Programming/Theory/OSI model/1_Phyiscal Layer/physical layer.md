Explain physical layer in OSI
==============================
The physical layer (layer 1) of the OSI model is responsible for transmitting bits over a physical medium, such as a copper wire or a fiber optic cable. It is the lowest layer of the OSI model and is responsible for providing a connection between devices on a network.

The physical layer defines the electrical, mechanical, and functional characteristics of the interface between the devices on a network. It specifies the type of cables or connectors that are used, the voltage levels and signaling rates that are used to transmit data, and the physical layout of the connectors and cables.

The physical layer is responsible for transmitting raw data bits between devices without adding any additional information or structure to the data. It does not provide any error detection or correction capabilities and relies on the higher layers of the OSI model to provide these functions.

Examples of physical layer protocols include Ethernet, Fibre Channel, and SONET/SDH. These protocols define the physical characteristics of the interface and the signaling scheme that is used to transmit data over the network.
